An Overview of OpenPNM
###############################################################################
The OpenPNM framework is built upon 5 main objects, **Networks**, **Geometries**, **Phases**, **Physics** and **Algorithms**, which are referred to as the **Core** objects.  All of these objects are derived from subclasses of the Python *dictionary*, which is a data storage class similar to a *struct* in C or Matlab.  Using a *dictionary* means that multiple pieces of data can be stored on each object, and accessed by name (i.e. ``obj['pore.diameter']``) which provide easy and direct access to the numerical data.  Each OpenPNM object stores its own data, so the **Network** object stores topological information, **Geometries** store pore and throat size related information, **Phases** store the physical properties of the fluids and solids in the network, **Physics** store pore-scale physics information, and **Algorithms** store the results of simulations and calculations.

===============================================================================
Main Modules
===============================================================================

1. The `Network`_ object has two main roles.  Firstly, it contains all the topological information about the **Network**, along with methods for querying the topology.  Secondly, **Networks** hold a special position since there can be only ONE network per simulation, so they are essentially the glue that holds the other objects together. The terms **Network** and **Simulation** are used interchangeably.

2. `Geometry`_ objects manage the pore-scale geometrical properties of the **Network** such as pore volume and throat diameter.  A simulation may have multiple **Geometry** objects depending on the problem being modeled.  For instance, a stratified material may have a separate **Geometry** object for each layer if the pore and throat sizes differ between them.

3. `Phase`_ objects contain information about the thermophysical properties of the liquids, gases, and solids required in the simulation.  For instance, a **Phase** object for water would possess its temperature, as well as models for calculating its viscosity as a function of temperature (and any other relevant properties).

4. `Physics`_ objects contain methods for calculating pores physical and conductance properties which use values from the **Phase** and **Geometry** objects. For instance, the hydraulic conductance of a throat requires knowing the throat diameter and length, as well as the fluid viscosity.

5. `Algorithms`_ are the objects that actually use the network properties defined by the above objects.  OpenPNM ships with an assortment of standard Algorithms, but is meant to be extended by users adding custom algorithms.

The 5 objects listed above interact with each other to create a *Simulation*.  When viewed schematically, these objects interact as shown in the following figure:

The vertical and horizontal overlap of these blocks represents the interactions of objects. As indicated, objects that overlap in the vertical dimension act on the same pores and throats, referred to generally as *locations*.  Objects that overlap in horizontal dimension interact with the same **Phase** object. For instance, ``Geometry 1`` overlaps with about half the pores (and throats) in the **Network**, but spans both ``Phase 1`` and ``Phase 2``.  ``Physics 1`` and ``Physics 3`` overlap with the same set of pores and throats as ``Geometry 1``, but each interacts with a different **Phase**.  This is because **Physics** objects require *geometric* information which is independent of the *phase* present in the pores, but it also requires thermophysical property information of the *phase*, hence one **Physics** is required for each **Phase**.  With this picture in mind, the relationships between objects and the flow of responsibility in the simulation as outlined below will hopefully be clear.

===============================================================================
Network
===============================================================================
A Cubic Network can be created with:

>>> import OpenPNM
>>> pn = OpenPNM.Network.Cubic(shape=[3,3,3],spacing=10,name='net1')
>>> print(pn)
------------------------------------------------------------
OpenPNM.Network.Cubic: 	net1
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Properties                          Valid Values
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.coords                            27 / 27
2     pore.index                             27 / 27
3     throat.conns                           54 / 54
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Labels                              Assigned Locations
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.all                            27
2     pore.back                           9
3     pore.bottom                         9
4     pore.front                          9
5     pore.internal                       27
6     pore.left                           9
7     pore.right                          9
8     pore.top                            9
9     throat.all                          54
------------------------------------------------------------

As can be seen from the print-out of the Network, ``pn`` has 27 pores with 54 throats, 3 *properties* and 9 *labels*.  The labels were applied to this Network by the **Cubic** generator, and they have no special meaning but are useful (with the exception of 'all', but more on this later).  The *'pore.coords'* and *'throat.conns'* properties, however, are absolutely essential as these define the topology and spatial arrangement of the pores and throats.  The **Network** object is explained further in the :ref:`Network Documentation<network>`.

===============================================================================
Geometry
===============================================================================
The **Network** object has no *pore-scale* geometric information such as *size* and *volume*.  This type of data is managed by **Geometry** objects.  A standard *stick and ball* **Geometry** object can be created with:

>>> geom = OpenPNM.Geometry.Stick_and_Ball(network=pn,pores=pn.pores('all'),throats=pn.throats('all'))
>>> print(geom)
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Properties                          Valid Values
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.area                              27 / 27
2     pore.diameter                          27 / 27
3     pore.seed                              27 / 27
4     pore.volume                            27 / 27
5     throat.area                            54 / 54
6     throat.diameter                        54 / 54
7     throat.length                          54 / 54
8     throat.seed                            54 / 54
9     throat.surface_area                    54 / 54
10    throat.volume                          54 / 54
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Labels                              Assigned Locations
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.all                            27
2     throat.all                          54
------------------------------------------------------------

This **Geometry** object contains all the expected pore-scale geometric information.  The *stick_and_ball* subclass is provided with OpenPNM and already contains all the pore scale models pre-selected.  Further details on creating a custom Geometry object are provided in the :ref:`Geometry Documentation<geometry>`.

The instantiation of this object has a few requirements.  Firstly, it must receive the **Network** (``pn``) object with which it is to be associated.  All **Core** objects have this requirement which allows the **Network** to track all objects that are associated with it (except **Networks** themselves).  Secondly, it must receive a list of pores and throats where it is to apply.  In the above example, ``geom`` applies to *all* pores and throats, but it possible and likely that multiple **Geometry** objects will be applied to the same **Network**.

===============================================================================
Phase
===============================================================================
In any simulation there are usually several fluids whose transport processes are to be simulated.  The thermo-physical properties of each of the fluids are managed by a **Phase** object:

>>> air = OpenPNM.Phases.Air(network=pn,name='air')
>>> print(air)
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Properties                          Valid Values
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.critical_pressure                 27 / 27
2     pore.critical_temperature              27 / 27
3     pore.diffusivity                       27 / 27
4     pore.molar_density                     27 / 27
5     pore.molecular_weight                  27 / 27
6     pore.pressure                          27 / 27
7     pore.temperature                       27 / 27
8     pore.viscosity                         27 / 27
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Labels                              Assigned Locations
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.all                            27
2     throat.all                          54
------------------------------------------------------------

The **Air** subclass is included with OpenPNM and contains all necessary models for calculating each property as a function of the conditions.  Building a custom **Phase** to represent other fluids is outlined in the :ref:`Phases Documentation<phases>`.

Notice that pores and throats were *not* sent to the initialization of ``air``.  This is because **`Phase** objects exist everywhere.  This might seem counterintuitive in a multiphase simulation where one phase displaces another, but it is much easier to calculate the **Phase** properties everywhere, then separately track where each phase is present and in what amount.

===============================================================================
Physics
===============================================================================
One of the main aims of pore network modeling is to combine phase properties with geometry sizes to estimate the behavior of a fluid as it moves through the pore space.  The pore-scale physics models required for this are managed by **Physics** objects:

>>> phys = OpenPNM.Physics.Standard(network=pn,phase=air,geometry=geom)
>>> print(phys)
------------------------------------------------------------
OpenPNM.Physics.Standard: 	Standard_SzZPQ
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Properties                          Valid Values
------------------------------------------------------------
1     throat.diffusive_conductance           54 / 54
2     throat.hydraulic_conductance           54 / 54
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Labels                              Assigned Locations
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.all                            27
2     throat.all                          54
------------------------------------------------------------

The *Standard* **Physics** object is a special subclass included with OpenPNM.  It uses the *standard* pore-scale physics models such as the *Hagen-Poiseuille* model for viscous pressure loss and the *Washburn* equation for capillarity.  Further details on creating custom **Physics** objects are provided in the :ref:`Physics Documentation<physics>`.

The **Physics** object requires several arguments in its instantiation.  Like all other **Core** objects, it requires a **Network** object with which it is to be associated.  It also requires the **Phase** to which it applies.  This enables it to ask ``air`` for viscosity values when calculating hydraulic conductance, for example.  Finally, it requires the **Geometry** where the **Physics** should apply (i.e. ``geom``).  The ``geom`` was assigned to pores and/or throats when it was created, so this information is adopted by the ``phys``.

===============================================================================
Algorithms
===============================================================================
The final step in performing a pore network simulation is to run some algorithms to model transport processes in the network.  OpenPNM comes with numerous algorithms, such as *FickianDiffusion* for modeling diffusion mass transport:

>>> alg = OpenPNM.Algorithms.FickianDiffusion(network=pn, phase=air)
>>> Ps1 = pn.pores(labels=['top'])
>>> alg.set_boundary_conditions(bctype='Dirichlet', bcvalue=0.6, pores=Ps1)
>>> Ps2 = pn.pores(labels=['bottom'])
>>> alg.set_boundary_conditions(bctype='Dirichlet', bcvalue=0.4, pores=Ps2)
>>> alg.run()
>>> print(alg)
------------------------------------------------------------
OpenPNM.Algorithms.FickianDiffusion: 	FickianDiffusion_kr2XO
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Properties                          Valid Values
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.air_bcval_Dirichlet               18 / 27
2     pore.air_mole_fraction                 27 / 27
3     throat.conductance                     54 / 54
------------------------------------------------------------
#     Labels                              Assigned Locations
------------------------------------------------------------
1     pore.air_Dirichlet                  18
2     pore.all                            27
3     throat.all                          54
------------------------------------------------------------

As can be seen in the above print-out, the **Algorithm** object contains some boundary condition related *properties* and *labels*, but more importantly, it contains *'pore.air_mole_fraction'* which is the result of the *FickianAlgorithm* simulation.  Each algorithm in OpenPNM will produce a different result with a different name, and this data stays encapsulated in the **Algorithm** object unless otherwise desired.  For instance, if the *'pore.air_mole_fraction'* data is required in another **Algorithm**, then it is necessary to write it to ``air`` using:

>>> air['pore.air_mole_fraction'] = alg['pore.air_mole_fraction']

or

>>> alg.return_results()

More detailed information about **Algorithm** objects can be found in the :ref:`Algorithm Documentation<algorithms>`
